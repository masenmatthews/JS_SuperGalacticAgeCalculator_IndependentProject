# _Super Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _An application that helps determine a user's age based on otherwordly solar years, {March 16, 2018}_

#### By _Masen Matthews_

## Description
  _This application takes a user's age and uses backend Javascript to convert it in a few different ways. First, it takes the user's birthday in years and converts it into seconds. Second, it can take an additional date (seperate from the initial birthday entry) and determine the difference in seconds between the two dates. Finally, the application can return the age of the human in Mercury, Venus, Mars, and/or Jupiter years.

  In addition to these functionalities, this application can approximate the user's remaining life expectancy. If the user has surpassed their life expectancy, the application can return the numbers of years beyond the life expectancy that have passed._
